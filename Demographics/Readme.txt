Women In Tech -- Demographic and Regional Differences
In order to elaborate my report, I used the following:

Two excel files with contact data and pupil demographic information of public schools in Scotland. Both were downloaded from the website of the Education Directorate, Scottish Government:

1--School+level+summary+statistics+2020.xlsx
2--School+Contacts+List+April+2021.xlsx

The compilation and correction of contact data, made from the two files above, is in this file:

0--School+level+summary+statistics+2020+compiled+values.xlsx

As additional data, the compilation of the contact data of independent schools, which are members of the SCIS (data compiled from their website) are in this file:

3--Sec-Ind-Schools.xlsx
This data was not used in the study, as it does not contain pupil demographics.


The geographical data used for the Geopandas maps is in this file:

Local_Authority_Boundaries_-_Scotland.zip

All references to the websites used and where to find the files are in my report.
