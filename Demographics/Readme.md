# Women In Tech -- Demographic and Regional Differences

In order to elaborate my report, I used the following:</br>

Two excel files with contact data and pupil demographic information of public schools in Scotland. Both were downloaded from the website of the Education Directorate, Scottish Government:</br>
- 1--School+level+summary+statistics+2020.xlsx</br>
- 2--School+Contacts+List+April+2021.xlsx</br>
</br>

The compilation and correction of contact data, made from the two files above, is in this file: </br>
- 0--School+level+summary+statistics+2020+compiled+values.xlsx </br>

As additional data, the compilation of the contact data of independent schools, which are members of the SCIS (data compiled from their website) are in this file: </br>
- 3--Sec-Ind-Schools.xlsx</br>

This data was not used in the study, as it does not contain pupil demographics.</br>
</br>

The geographical data used for the Geopandas maps is in this file: </br>
- Local_Authority_Boundaries_-_Scotland.zip</br>
</br>

All references to the websites used and where to find the files are in my report.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68565604/135055821-fa743b24-66f8-4e50-a778-4222cee7e43d.png)
