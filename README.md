# Changes and mergers in colleges in Scotland

In order to elaborate maps of location and gender distribution of colleges, it is necessary to compile a list of geographical coordinates of the colleges. They have more than one campus, which divides this task in several parts: </br>

	a) To show a map of Scotland with the locations of the campuses.</br>
	</br>
		This map has no relation with gender distribution in computer science subjects, as we do not know which campuses offer the awards listed by the SQA. More discussion about this in the Jupiter notebook.</br>
		  
	b) Maps of the colleges that offer the courses, as per the Infract database. The names of the campuses are not mentioned, unless they appear during 2005 to 2013, where the majority existed as individual colleges before the mergers in 2013.</br>

Due to this, some locations had to be chosen by default, when mapping the recent years. Information about the mergers is given below.  </br>

__1.- Edin Telford College__</br>
	It is the current Edinburgh College at Cranton Campus (see point 9).</br>

__2.- Adam Smith College__</br>
           It merged in 2013 with Carnegie College and the Elmwood Campus of the SRUC in a new college, Fife college, becoming its Dunfermline Campus.</br>
