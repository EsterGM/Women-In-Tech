# Changes and mergers in colleges in Scotland

In order to elaborate maps of location and gender distribution of colleges, it is necessary to compile a list of geographical coordinates of the colleges. They have more than one campus, which divides this task in several parts: </br>

	- To show a map of Scotland with the locations of the campuses.</br>
</br>
    This map has no relation with gender distribution in computer science subjects, as we do not know which campuses offer the awards listed by the SQA. More discussion about this in the Jupiter notebook.</br>
	  
	-  Maps of the colleges that offer the courses, as per the Infract database. The names of the campuses are not mentioned, unless they appear during 2005 to 2013, where the majority existed as individual colleges before the mergers in 2013.</br>

Due to this, some locations had to be chosen by default, when mapping the recent years. Information about the mergers is given below.  </br>

__1.- Edin Telford College__</br>
	It is the current Edinburgh College at Cranton Campus (see point 9).</br>

__2.- Adam Smith College__</br>
           It merged in 2013 with Carnegie College and the Elmwood Campus of the SRUC in a new college, Fife college, becoming its Dunfermline Campus.</br>

__3.- Carnegie College__</br>
	Same situation as with Adam Smith College. It is also located in Dunfermline Campus.</br>

__4.- Banff and Buchan College__</br>
	It is currently the Fraserburgh Campus of Edinburgh College.</br>

__5.- Central Glasgow College__</br>
	It is the Central College, previously known as Central College of Commerce.</br>
	It merged with the Glasgow Metropolitan College and the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies to form the City of Glasgow College in 2010.</br>

__6.-  Stow College__</br>
	Merged with John Wheatley College and North Glasgow College in 2013 to form Glasgow Kelvin College. </br>Currently does not exist anymore (the building is still standing in Garnethill).</br>

__7.- James Watt College__</br>
	- The previous campus in Greenock joined West College in  2013.</br>
	- The campus in Kilwinning merged with Ayrshire College the same year.</br>
	
	If the datasets specify "Ayrshire College", I used the coordinates in Ayr. If it is specified as "James Watt" alone, I used the coordinates in Kilwinning. When "James Watt" was used together with West College, I used the coordinates in Greenock.</br>
	
__8.- West College Scotland__</br>
	Created on 1 August 2013 by the merger of Clydebank College, Reid Kerr College in Paisley and James Watt College in Greenock. </br>
	
__9.- Jewel and Esk College__</br>
	It had 2 campuses (Milton Road in Edinburgh and Eskbank in Dalkeith, Midlothian), which merged with another 2 colleges in Edinburgh city: Telford College and Stevenson College. The 4 colleges became campuses of the new Edinburgh College in 2012.</br>
</br>
It is not possible to find geographical coordinates for the ones that do not exist and for colleges that changed their names due to mergers. The "chosen college" follows the latest available information and is listed in column J of the cvs files. </br>

There are another two notebooks (one for Software Development and another for Web development), that show the pupil distribution by college name, year and region and no geographical information was needed.
